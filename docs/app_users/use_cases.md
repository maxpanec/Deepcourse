User account creation: Allow users to create their own accounts so they can save their flashcard sets, quiz results, and study progress.

Flashcard creation and customization: Provide users with an interface to create their own flashcards. Users should be able to add text, images, and other media to their cards, and customize the appearance and organization of their sets.

Quiz generation: Create a tool that generates quizzes based on a given flashcard set. Users should be able to select from different quiz formats, such as multiple choice, true/false, or fill-in-the-blank questions. The quiz should be automatically generated based on the information in the flashcards.

Quiz scoring and tracking: Keep track of user quiz scores and progress for each flashcard set. Users should be able to see their overall quiz score for a set, as well as a timeline of their scores over time. This will help users track their progress and identify areas they need to study more.

Feedback and improvement: Encourage users to provide feedback on the app, and use that feedback to improve the app's functionality and user experience over time.
